This project was to analyze customer behavior and identify key factors influencing customer churn Using a telecom customer dataset.
Tools & Technologies used:
Python
Pandas, NumPy – Data cleaning & manipulation
Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization
Jupyter Notebook – Analysis environment

Data Cleaning & Preparation:
Handled missing values and incorrect data types.
Performed encoding of categorical variables.
Normalized numerical columns such as MonthlyCharges and TotalCharges.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Tenure is a strong indicator—customers with shorter tenure churn more.
Month-to-month contracts show the highest churn rate.
Customers using Electronic Check payment method churn more than others.
